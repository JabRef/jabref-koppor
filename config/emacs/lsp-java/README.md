Emacs with lsp-java needs some setup.

`.classpath` is needed for finding JARs and sources

`.project` and `.settings` were autogenerated by lsp-java


These name however appear in .gitignore excluding them from git.

So I moved them here and provided a Makefile, so that
`make setup`
will establish symlinks to these.

However, these names happen to be ignored recursively.
To avoid more changes to .gitignore, I prefixed them here with eclips-jdt.
